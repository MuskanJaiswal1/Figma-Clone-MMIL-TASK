            <h1>Introduce Your Product <br> Quickly and Effectively</h1>
            <p> Figma is a web-based graphics editing and user <br> interface design app. You can use it to do all <br>
                kinds of graphic design work from wireframing <br> websites, designing mobile app interfaces, <br>

                The official Figma team has put together a <br> series of courses to teach you the basics of <br>
                Design. It includes a dozen video <br> tutorials with design exercises. If youâ€™re new <br> to UI and UX
                design, these videos are <br> worth exploring. </p>

            <h1>Light, Fast & Powerful</h1>
            <p>Figma is so much more than a typical design <br> tool. With its collaborative and cloud-based <br>
                features, it's easy to create and share stunning designs. <br> What truly sets Figma apart are its team
                and
                <br> community-based features. For example, you can <br> invite as many people as you want to view <br>
                and
                comment on your creations, any viewer <br> can inspect your design file's code and exporting <br> in
                your
                preferred format is a breeze.
                <br> <br> You don't have to be on a design team to enjoy Figma's <br> collaborative perks, though. With
                its
                extensive library of <br> community-made templates, widgets and plugins, you'll <br> always have a fresh

            <h1>A Price To Suit Everyone</h1>
            <p>The importance of good UI and UX can't be understated. <br> As user tastes become more refined, and competition in the digital space becomes more fierce, <br> businesses can't afford unintuitive, clunky, or inconsistent interfaces that don't work the way users expect. It's <br> effectively the key to attracting new users - and retaining them for longer.
